        <h3>Description</h3>
        
        <p>I don’t think I’ve ever been as frustrated when recipe testing as I was when it came to trialing out an eggless vanilla cake!</p>

        <p>Well, I can laugh about it now, because after some drastic changes to the methods I was using, I finally came up with the perfect eggless vanilla cake! It is soft, moist, flavourful and you wouldn’t have a clue that it didn’t have any eggs! I frosted mine with my stabilized whipped cream frosting recipe, but it will literally pair perfectly with almost any type of frosting.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
           <li>2½ cups (330 g) flour - regular, all purpose</li>
            <li>2½ tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>½ tsp salt</li>
            <li>¾ cup (185 g) yoghurt - regular (not Greek - see note 1), room temperature</li>
            <li>1½ cups (300 g) white granulated sugar</li>
            <li>And other stuff</li>           
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch casserole dish.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add noodles and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl combine eggs, ricotta cheese, mushroom soup, Cheddar cheese, Parmesan cheese, sour cream and soup mix.</li>
            <li>In prepared dish layer noodles, cheese mixture, broccoli, carrots and corn. Repeat layers with remaining ingredients, ending with cheese</li>
            <li>Bake, covered, in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Uncover and bake an additional 10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
